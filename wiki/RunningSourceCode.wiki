=Running AltAnalyze from Source Code=

AltAnalyze is provided with binary distributions for the Mac and Windows operating systems. If you are using AltAnalyze in Linux or are having problems with these binaries (un-expected program crashes due to specific OS incompatibilities), you have the option of running AltAnalyze directly from the distributed source code in the AltAnalyze main program directory.
    * PC – Installation of python is required, since it is not distributed by default on PCs. To download the Python 2.4 installer for Windows (recommended), [http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.4/python-2.4.ia64.msi click here]. Once installed, open a Command Prompt from the Windows Start Menu, (All Programs>Accessories>Command Prompt), change directories to AltAnalyze_v1beta (main program directory extracted by the user). Once in this directory typing “python AltAnalyze.py” in the terminal window will begin to run AltAnalyze (you should see the AltAnalyze main menu within a matter of seconds).
    * Mac – Installation of python is not required, since OS X is bundled with python by default. To run, open a terminal window (e.g. Applications/Utilities/Terminal) and change directories to the AltAnalyze program folder (e.g., cd Applications/AltAnalyze_v1beta). Once in this directory typing “python AltAnalyze.py” in the terminal window will begin to run AltAnalyze (you should see the AltAnalyze main menu within a matter of seconds).
    * Linux – Installation of python is usually not required, since it is present with most Linux installations. To run AltAnalyze, open a terminal window and go to the AltAnalyze main folder (e.g. “cd AltAnalyze_v1beta” from the program parent directory). Once in this directory typing “python AltAnalyze.py” in the terminal window will begin to run AltAnalyze (you should see the AltAnalyze main menu within a matter of seconds).
