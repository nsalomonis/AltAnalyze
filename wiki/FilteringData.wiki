#summary FAQ-Filtering Alternative Exon Array Data

===_Why does AltAnalyze need to filter my data?_===

_*Answer*_: Prior to alternative exon analysis, AltAnalyze can be used to remove probe sets that are not deemed as sufficiently expressed. This filtering is important since including non-expressed probesets can result in false positive alternative exon detection. This occurs when the expression of a non-expressed probeset is normalized to the expression of the gene (e.g., constitutive probesets). Thus, if a gene is transcriptionally regulated, it can result in an artificial change in probeset expression, after normalization. For this reason, by default, AltAnalyze removes probesets that are not expressed above a non-log expression value of 70 and have a [DABG] p-value of less than 0.05. These filters can be adjusted by the user, for example, if a user does not want to filter their data, they can set these thresholds both equal to 1 (expression values below 1 do not exist for [RMA]).

_Probeset Filtering Method_
For the two conditions that AltAnalyze compares (e.g., cancer versus normal), a probe set will be removed if neither condition has a mean detection above background ([DABG]) p value less than the user threshold (e.g., 0.05). Likewise, if neither condition has a mean probe set intensity greater than the user threshold (e.g., 70), then the probe set will be excluded from the analysis. When comparing two conditions (pairwise comparison) for probe sets used to determine gene transcription (e.g., constitutive aligning), both conditions will be required to meet these expression thresholds in order to ensure that the genes are expressed in both conditions and thus reliable for detecting alternative exons as opposed to changes in transcription. When comparing all biological groups in the user dataset, however, these additional filters are not used.
