#summary AltAnalyze Statistical Methods

== Statistical Methods Implemented in AltAnalyze ==

AltAnalyze implements various previously described algorithms for gene expression quantification, differential gene expression, alternative exon expression and feature/pathway over-representation. These algorithms are implemented in the context of a rigorous exon/transcript annotation framework, based on data from Ensembl and UCSC mRNAs. Details on all of these methods is *[http://www.altanalyze.org/help.htm provided here]*.

In general, implemented methods include:

===Gene Expression Analyses===

 * Robust Multichip Analysis (*Affymetrix*)
 * Detection Above Background p-values (*Affymetrix*)
 * Quantile normalization (*RNASeq*)
 * RPKM (gene, exon, junction) (*RNASeq*)
 * Geometric fold calculation
 * [ModeratedTest Moderated and conventional t-tests and f-tests]

===[ScoringMethod Alternative Exon Analyses]===

 * Reciprocal-junction analyses (ASPIRE, Linear regression)
 * Alternative exon (splicing-index, FIRMA, MiDAS, adjusted f-tests)

===[http://genmapp.org/go_elite/help.htm#s4 Over-representation]===

 * Fisher Exact Test
 * Z score calculation
 * Permutation-based p-values

===LineageProfiler analysis===

 * Pearson/Spearman's correlation
 * Z score calculation
