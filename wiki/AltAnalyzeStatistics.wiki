#summary AltAnalyze Statistical Methods

== Statistical Methods Implemented in AltAnalyze ==

AltAnalyze implements various previously described algorithms for gene expression quantification, differential gene expression, alternative exon expression and feature/pathway over-representation. These algorithms are implemented in the context of a rigorous exon/transcript annotation framework, based on data from Ensembl and UCSC mRNAs. Details on all of these methods is provided [http://www.altanalyze.org/help.htm here].

In general, implemented methods include:

*Gene Expression Analyses*

 * Geometric fold calculation
 * Moderated and conventional t-tests and f-tests

*Alternative Exon Analyses*

 * Reciprocal-junction analyses (ASPIRE, Linear regression)
 * Alternative exon (splicing-index, FIRMA, MiDAS, adjusted f-tests)

*Over-representation*

 * Fisher Exact Test
 * Z score calculation
 * Permutation-based p-values

*LineageProfiler analysis*

 * Pearson/Spearman's correlation
 * Z score calculation
