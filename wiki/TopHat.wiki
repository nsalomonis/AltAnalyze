===Example Commands===

*Analyze a single non-paired end sample FASTQ file*

{{{
tophat --GTF /work/Common/Data/Reference_RNASeq_Assembly_GTF/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.56.chr.gtf --keep-tmp --output-dir /home/user/tophat_data/NP902 hg19 /home/user/hESC-NP/SRS011902-NP.fq
}}}

*Obtaining exon expression estimates from TopHat BAM files*

Install [BEDTools] and call the script bamToBed (recognized on Unix systems once BEDTools has been added to the local or global .bashrc file). The file accepted_hits.bam is produced with each TopHat run in the same output directory as the junction BED file. 

In the below example, "hESC_differentiation_exons.bed" is produced by AltAnalyze prior to running BEDTools ([BAMtoBED see instructions here]), containing all known mRNA exon region coordinates from Ensembl/UCSC and all novel exon coordinates indicated from the TopHat junction BED results. These methods should work equivalently for non-TopHat produced BAM files, however, additional sorting of the BAM file may be required (e.g., SAMTools). 

_Example BEDTools command_
{{{
bamToBed -i accepted_hits.bam -split| coverageBed -a stdin -b /home/user/BAMtoBED/hESC_differentiation_exons.bed > /home/user/RNASeqStudy/Sample1/day0_s1__exons.bed
