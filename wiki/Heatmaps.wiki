#summary Clustering Heatmaps

== AltAnalyze Hierarchical Clustering Heatmaps ==

Currently, AltAnalyze users can perform hierarchical clustering in one of two ways:

 # Through analysis of raw array or RNA-Seq data (*Workflow Analysis*)
 # Immediate analysis of filtered fold files (*Independent Analysis*)

For both approaches, a colored gene expression heatmap is produced with arrays clustered (columns) and genes clustered (rows) using basic methods found in other clustering programs, such as Cluster/TreeView. AltAnalyze makes this process extremely simple, with the user only needed to providing their transcriptome datasets.

*Visualization Support*

Support for heatmap visualization and hierarchical clustering is provided through the Python libraries matplotlib and scipy. These libraries are included in the operating system included bundles of AltAnalyze (binary versions). When compiling direct from source code, these libraries and Numpy must be installed by the user. The library fastcluster is optional and may improve efficiency (included with the binaries). See 

===Workflow Analysis===

This analysis is the standard workflow for microarrays and RNA-Seq data (see [Tutorials tutorials]). In this workflow, differentially expressed or outlier genes (defined based on the user's statistical filtering options) are clustered using default coloring and distance algorithms. In addition to genes, cell-type predictions from the new method LineageProfiler are also clustered using this method (see LineageProfiler description for details). When finished with an analysis, the user will be presented with these plots in the interface and can be also be found in the folder {{{ *DataPlots* }}}. These input data matrices can also be re-clustered with different options following an analysis (*Additional Analyses* option - see below).

The three default plots for genes are:
 # Significant regulated genes (relative to the *row mean*)
 # Significant regulated genes (relative to the *comparison group mean*)
 # Outlier regulated genes (relative to the *row mean*)

All of these plot the log2 fold changes relative to the row mean or comparison mean. The first of these clusters indicates how all samples compare to other samples, without considering specific user-comparisons (e.g., day 10 versus day 0). The second is for the same genes but with fold changes for each sample to the control group mean for any user-defined comparison (including control samples versus the control mean). The third is for any sample for any non-significant genes with a fold change greater than the user-defined fold threshold (default 2 fold) for a given sample versus the mean of all samples in that row.

===Independent Analysis===

In addition to running the workflow version of hierarchical clustering, users can select the *Additional Analyses* option to run hierarchical clustering any tab-delimited text file. This text file must have a header row of column annotations (e.g. sample names) and the first column with row annotations (e.g. gene names) and the remaining by positive and negative values. Multiple options for positive and negative gradients can be selected, along with clustering algorithms for rows and columns.
