#summary Instructions for Manual Database Creation

== Creating an AltAnalyze Database From Scratch ==

Although most users will wish to wait for the official AltAnalyze database release, users and developers can also build and customize these databases themselves.

=== Adding Support for a New Ensembl Build ===

New AltAnalyze databases can be built in a semi-automated fashion using builtin [CommandLineMode command-line] arguments. For microarray specific databases (e.g., Affymetrix Exon 1.0, Gene 1.0 and Junction JAY arrays), users will need to download two files for each array type and species before running the update. Files can be found [http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx? here].
 # Probeset annotation file
 # Probeset sequence file (Affymetrix Exon arrays only)

An example probeset annotation file is the "MoEx-1_0-st-v1.na31.mm9.probeset.csv.zip". These files will need to be saved to the appropriate species and array type destination directory for that species and extracted to that directory. For example, if downloading the human exon array annotations for build 61 of Ensembl, save these to the folder AltDatabase/EnsMart61/Hs/exon. 

Once installation is complete, additional files will have to be added to the final database installation package, however, these can be found with existing database installations (probes_to_remove and probeset-probes association - e.g., AltDatabase/EnsMart55/Hs).

*Build Commands*

Build all databases for all arrays and all species
{{{
python AltAnalyze.py --species all --arraytype all --update all --version 61
}}}


Build specific databases for select arrays and species

{{{
AltAnalyze.py --update Ensembl --update UniProt --update Probeset --update Domain --update miRBs --species Mm --arraytype exon --arraytype gene --arraytype junction --version 61
}}}
