= Building a Dataset Exon Database for BEDTools =

While junction-level input files can be directly produced by several junction finding algorithms (e.g., TopHat, HMMSplicer, SpliceMap) for AltAnalyze, exon-level input files must currently be produced through an intermediate set of steps. These steps are:
 # Obtain a BAM alignment file (e.g., TopHat)
 # Output known and novel exons from junction.bed files with AltAnalyze
 # Produce exon-level bed read counts with BEDTools
 # Name the exon and junction BED files so that AltAnalyze appropriately
