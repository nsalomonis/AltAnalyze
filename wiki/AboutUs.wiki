==About Us==

AltAnalyze is a software project principally run by developers in the [http://www.conklinlab.org Bruce Conklin laboratory] at the J. David Gladstone Institutes and the University of California San Francisco. The goal of this project is to provide easy to use applications for biologists with little computational training as well as computational biologists for the analysis of microarray and ultimately RNA sequencing datasets. AltAnalyze is funded by an NIH Ro1 grant (ARRA Suppl. GM080223-06S1).

Our hope, is that AltAnalyze and associated tools will help researchers to provide greater biological insight and uncover new mechanisms that regulate cellular biology. Thus, much of the focus of AltAnalyze is on functional interpretation of results rather than the development of new statistical methods. Examples include protein domain, microRNA binding site and pathway analysis. An ongoing goal of ours is to transition AltAnalyze to the Cytoscape environment, providing new tools for RNA sequencing and alternative splicing microarray analysis, sequence motif analysis, discovery of novel alternative exons and transcripts and associated data visualization. As a part of Cytoscape, AltAnalyze will be able to utilize many of the powerful tools built for this environment (e.g., expression clustering, visualization of multiple data types and complex network analyses). 

If you would like to contribute to AltAnalyze development or to the documentation on this site, we welcome your contributions.
