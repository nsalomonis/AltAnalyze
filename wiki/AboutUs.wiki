==About Us==

AltAnalyze is an open-source software project principally run by developers in the [http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/bio/s/nathan-salomonis Nathan Salomonis laboratory] at Cincinnati Children's Hosptial Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati. This project began in the laboratory of [http://www.conklinlab.org  Bruce Conklin] at the Gladstone Institutes. The goal of this project is to provide easy to use applications for biologists with little computational training as well as computational biologists for the analysis of microarray and ultimately RNA sequencing datasets.

Our hope, is that AltAnalyze and associated tools will help researchers to provide greater biological insight and uncover new mechanisms that regulate cellular biology. Thus, much of the focus of AltAnalyze is on functional interpretation of results in addition to the development of new analytical methods to evaluate alternative splicing and regulatory control.

If you would like to contribute to AltAnalyze development or to the documentation on this site, we welcome your contributions.
