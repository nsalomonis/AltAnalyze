#summary Example Junction BED format

== Example Junction BED Format ==

Below is the column format used in the junction-level BED file recognized by AltAnalyze. When a .bed file containing these 12 fields is imported, AltAnalyze will assume the data are detected junctions from your experiment. This can be RNA-seq or even an unsupported microarray. Default expression is non-log read counts but can be log2 (select format as log in AltAnalyze). The notes field can include any or no information. 

||chr||position1||position2||notes||expression||strand||start||stop||null||null||exon lengths||null||
||chr19||3266448||3267268||JUNC00000001||2||-||3266448||3267268||255,0,0||2||11,27||0,793||

When read is on the positive strand:
 * 5' splice-site: position1+length1
 * 3' splice-site: position2-length2+1

When read is negative strand:
 * 5' splice-site: position2-length2+1
 * 3' splice-site: position1+length1
