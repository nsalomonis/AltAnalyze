#summary AltAnalyze Description

= Introduction =

AltAnalyze is an analysis tool designed to analyze your RNA-Seq aligned sequences or Affymetrix CEL files to produce annotated gene expression files with group statistics and alternative exon analysis results, along with a wide array of functional enrichment and data visualization outputs. AltAnalyze can be used for conventional microarrays (gene expression only), [RNASeq] data, as well as splicing sensitive arrays (exon and [http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/2/268.abstract junction]). This software performs identical analyses on both [http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=hugene-1_0-st-v1 Affymetrix Gene 1.0] and [http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=huexon-st Exon 1.0 arrays]. In addition to Affymetrix CEL file analyses, AltAnalyze can perform gene expression analyses on post-normalized expression files for array manufacturers with annotations at [Ensembl] (e.g., [http://www.illumina.com/ Illumina], [http://agilent.com Agilent], [http://www.appliedmicroarrays.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=15&Itemid=23 CodeLink]).

= Alternative Exon Analyses=

With AltAnalyze and the integrated software DomainGraph (Cytoscape), users have access to a wide spectrum of predictions on the impact of alternative exon inclusion on protein sequence, domain sequence and microRNA binding site inclusion. Specific features include:
  * _Identification and visualization of associated protein isoforms_
  * _Identification and visualization of affected protein domains/motifs_
  * _Pathway over-representation and visualization_
  * _Domain/motif over-representation_
