#summary FAQ-Removing cross-hybridization probesets

===_How can I remove probesets with sequence that aligns to multiple genomic loci from my analysis?_===


_*Answer*_: Whether you are using the graphical user interface or [CommandLineMode command-line mode], you can choose to remove genomic cross-hybridizing probesets. 

If you are working in the graphical user interface, you can eliminate these by selecting "Remove probesets with a large cross-hybridization score" option when selecting CEL files to analyze:

You can also do this in the [CommandLineMode command-line] by adding the flag "--noxhyb yes" which instructs AltAnalyze to exclude cross-hybridizing probesets. These annotations are obtained from annotation files produced for the [http://biogibbs.stanford.edu/~yxing/MADS/Annotation.html MADS software].

You can also do this yourself by downloading the Affymetrix probeset annotation file for your exon array (e.g., [http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=huexon-st HuEx-1_0-st-v1.na31.mm9.probeset.csv]) from the [http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx? Affymetrix website] and identifying probesets with several probes that cross-hybridize according to the column "number_cross_hyb_probes".
