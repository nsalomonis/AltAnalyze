#summary Proteomics Analysis in AltAnalyze

==Proteomics Analysis in AltAnalyze==

Proteomics experiments typically produce quantitative values associated with protein, peptide or gene identifiers. AltAnalyze supports import and analysis of proteomics data assuming:
 * IDs correspond to any of the many supported input ID systems
 * Quantitative values are non-zero (ideally log2)

Input IDs do not have to correspond to one of the above, but will if annotations and enrichment analyses are desired in AltAnalyze. Supported analyses include:
 # Differential protein expression statistics (e.g., moderated t-test)
 # Protein/gene annotation (e.g., name, Pathways, Ontologies)
 # Sample classification (LineageProfiler)
 # Marker prediction (MarkerFinder)
 # Quantile and batch-effects normalization
 # Hierarchical clustering 
 # 2D and 3D PCA
 # Basic sample QC visualization
 # Pathway enrichment analysis and visualization

===Data Import===

To import data, simple select the *Vendor/data-type* as *Other ID* and the appropriate ID system under the menu *Select platform*. Proceed with the default or customized options.
