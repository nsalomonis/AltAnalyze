#summary LineageProfiler Description

== Lineage Profiler Analysis Program  ==

=== Overview ===

LineageProfiler is a program used to identify the most likely cell types and tissues represented in a given RNA sample. These results are then visualized at the level of hierarchically clustered cell types and samples and upon a comprehensive curated lineage network. This software can be applied to microarray and RNA-Seq profiling data. While this tool is integrated with the full AltAnalyze analysis workflows, it can also be run independently on data processed outside of AltAnalyze.
