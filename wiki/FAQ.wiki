=AltAnalyze Frequently Asked Questions=
===Data Analysis and Import===

    * [CompatibleArrays What microarrays can AltAnalyze work with?]
    * [CompatibleOS What operating systems is AltAnalyze compatible with?]
    * [RequiredFiles What files do I need when analyzing Affymetrix arrays?]
    * [SpliceVisualization How can I visualize splicing and domain level changes from AltAnalyze?]

===Probeset Alignments and DomainGraph===

    * [ExonMappings How do AltAnalyze probeset-to-gene and probeset-to-exon mappings differ from those in the Affymetrix annotation files?]
    * [DGIntronMapping In AltAnalyze a probeset associated with an intron is predicted to alter protein domain composition of the protein, but in DomainGraph why don't I see the probeset?]
    * [DGvsAltAnalyzeDomain Can DomainGraph show protein domain changes not predicted in AltAnalyze?]

===Interpreting Results===

    * [OppositeMappings If two probesets align to one exon and have opposite splicing changes, what does this mean?]
