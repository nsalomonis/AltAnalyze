#summary SubgeneViewer Description

== Introduction ==
SubgeneViewer is a plugin in development for the network visualization software Cytoscape. Slated to be released as a part of GenMAPP-CS beta in late 2011, SubgeneViewer allows users to examine the complete exon, junction and intron structure of a gene and view associated exon expression data. Annotations for SubgeneViewer are derived from AltAnalyze during the database build process.
