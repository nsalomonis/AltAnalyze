===_What microarrays can AltAnalyze work with?_===

*_Answer_*: AltAnalyze can work with nearly any gene expression microarrays (e.g., [http://www.affymetrix.com Affymetrix], [http://www.illumina.com/ Illumina], [http://agilent.com Agilent], [http://www.appliedmicroarrays.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=15&Itemid=23 CodeLink]). However, alternative exon analyses are currently only compatible with the Affymetrix [http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=huexon-st Exon 1.0], [http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=hugene-1_0-st-v1 Gene 1.0], [JAY] (junction array) and [AltMouse] custom arrays. AltAnalyze can summarize gene expression data from Affymetrix gene expression microarrays (e.g., 3' expression arrays, exon and junction), by calling the embedded package [APT] to perform [RMA]. For these arrays, AltAnalyze organizes the raw data, annotates probe set level data, and calculates statistics (fold and f-test p-values). For non-Affymetrix arrays (e.g., [http://www.illumina.com/ Illumina], [http://agilent.com Agilent], [http://www.appliedmicroarrays.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=15&Itemid=23 CodeLink]), AltAnalyze will organize input expression values, calculate statistics and annotate probe level data using built-in annotations from Ensembl and WikiPathways. For alternative splicing sensitive Affymetrix microrarrays, AltAnalyze will also determine transcriptional changes in addition to identifying probesets which deviate from transcriptional expression of a gene.

While there are ways to customize AltAnalyze for conventional expression array analyses (gene expression only), alternative exon analyses *are not supported* "out-of-the-box" for non-supported array types. To inquire about support for these arrays, please contact our [ContactUs user groups].
