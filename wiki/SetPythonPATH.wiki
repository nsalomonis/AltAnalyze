=== Setting Python Path in Windows ===

In order to run AltAnalyze on a Windows operating system, you will need to set the Python PATH following installation. This will allow you to type "python" in the "Command Prompt" (under "All Programs" > "Accessories") in order to call python programs. Perform the following after installing Python (e.g., Python 2.6).

 1. Open "Control Panel" > "System" > "Advanced System Settings" > "Environmental Variables"
 2. Under "System Variables" open "PATH"
 3. Append the path of python to the paths (e.g., ";C:\Python26")
 4. Select the "OK" button.
 5. Open a new Command Prompt window and type "python". The following should be displayed:

Python 2.6.1 (#1, Nov 27 2010, 12:52:40) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on Win32
