=== Setting Python Path in Windows ===

In order to run AltAnalyze on a Windows operating system, you will need to set the Python PATH following installation. This will allow you to type "python" in the "Command Prompt" (under "All Programs" > "Accessories") in order to call python programs. Perform the following after installing Python (e.g., Python 2.6).

 # Open "Control Panel" > "System" > "Advanced System Settings" > "Environmental Variables"
 # Under "System Variables" open "PATH"
 # Append the path of python to the paths (e.g., ";C:\Python26")
 # Select the "OK" button.
 # Open a new Command Prompt window and type "python". The following should be displayed:
