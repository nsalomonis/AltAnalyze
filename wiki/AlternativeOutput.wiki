#summary AlternativeOutput Description

The AlternativeOutput directory contains results from an alternative exon analysis. These files are typically the most informative results from an AltAnalyze analysis. These include:
 * (exon-inclusion-results) Alternative exon scores, annotations and protein/motif predictions for significant probesets
 * (exon-inclusion-GENE-results) Summarized exon scores, annotations and protein/motif predictions reported for each unique gene only
 * (ft-domain-zscores) Over-representation results for each impacted protein domain/motif
 * (microRNA-zscores) Over-representation results for each impacted protein microRNA binding site
 * (summary-results) Overview summary statistics for each analysis
 * (all-genes-comparisons-events) Combined exon results for multiple analyses in a single file
 * (all-genes-GENE-comparisons-events) Combined gene results for multiple analyses in a single file
