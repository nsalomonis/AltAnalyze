#summary Metabolomics Analysis in AltAnalyze

==Metabolomics Analysis in AltAnalyze==

Metabolomics experiments typically produce quantitative values associated with chemical identifiers (PubChem, KEGGcompound, HMDB, ChEBI, CAS). AltAnalyze supports import and analysis of metabolomics data assuming:
 * IDs correspond to one of the above chemical ID systems
 * Quantitative values are non-zero (ideally log2)

Input IDs do not have to correspond to one of the above, but will if annotations and enrichment analyses are desired in AltAnalyze. Supported analyses include:
 # Differential metabolite expression statistics (e.g., moderated t-test)
 # Metabolite annotation (e.g., name, KEGG< WikiPathways)
 # Hierarchical clustering 
 # 2D and 3D PCA
 # Basic sample QC visualization
 # Pathway enrichment analysis and visualization
